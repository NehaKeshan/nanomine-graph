  cd /apps/whyis
  python manage.py load -i /apps/NanomineViz/data/ontology.setl.ttl -f turtle
  python manage.py load -i /apps/NanomineViz/data/xml_ingest.setl.ttl -f turtle
  ```
- go to http://localhost/ to login with your credentials during "createuser" command
- go to http://localhost/viz to access the visualization

# Developing mode
Each time a change is made on the visualization, apache2 and celeryd service have to be restarted manually. 
This is very troublesome. whyis has a developing mode that help you allevate this pain. 
```
sudo su - whyis
cd /app/whyis
python manage.py runserver -h 0.0.0.0
``` 
The visualization then will be accessed on "http://localhost:5000/viz".
Then, you only need to refresh your webpage to see your changes immediately after you make changes to the visualization. 
After you finished the visualization changes, you can shutdown the developing mode with CTRL+c.
Then you have to restart apache2 and celeryd service by
```
sudo service apache2 restart
sudo service celeryd restart
```
After this, the updated visualization app will show up at "http://localhost/viz".
